. -£ ENGINEER SONG.

An engineer told me before he died. (Ah hum tittie bum, tittie bum, tittie bum)
An engineer told me before he died. (Ah hum Ah hum)

An engineer told me before he died.

I have no reason to believe he lied. (Ah hum tittie bum, tittie bum, tittie bum.)

(Ah hum tittie bum, tittie bum, tittie bum.)

He had a wife with a cunt so wide.(etc)
That she could never be satisfied.

So he built a bloody great wheel,
With balls of brass and a prick of steel.

The balls of brass he filled with cream
And the whole fucking thing was driven by steam.

He tied her legs to the foot of the bed,
And he tied her hands above her head.

There she lay demanding a fuck,
He shook her hand and he wished her luck.

__vund and round went the bloody great wheel,
And in and out went the prick of steel.

Up and up went the level of steam,
And down and down went the level of cream.

°Til at last our maiden cried,
"Enough enough, I’m satisfied.”

Now we cum to the tragic bit,
There was no way of stopping it!

She was split from ass to tit, And the whole bloody thing was covered in
(slowly) Sweet violets, sweeter than roses, covered all over,
Covered all over from head to toe, covered all over in SHIT SHIT SHIT.

Alternate Endings:
It jumped off her, and it jumped on him; And then it buggered their next of kin.

It jumped onto an uptown bus; And the mess it made caused quite a fuss.
© months later a child was born; With 2 brass balls and a big bloody horn.

The moral of this tale is mighty clear; Never fuck with an engineer.

(

E BALL OF KIRRIEMUIR (FOUR AND TWENTY VIRGINS.

CHORUS Singing balls to your partner, ass against the wall.
If you’ve never been buggered on Saturday night,

You’ve never been buggered at all.

Four and twenty virgins

Came down from Inverness.
And when the ball was over,
There were four and twenty less.

The village cripple, he was there,
He wasn’t-up to much.

He lined them up against the wall,
And shagged them with his crutch.

The queen was in the parlor,
Eating bread and honey.

The king was in the chambermaid,
And she was in the money.

The village policeman he was there,
The pride of all the force.

zy found him in the stable
Jacking off his horse.

The bride was in the kitchen,
Explaining to the groom,
The vagina, not the rectum,
Is the entrance to the womb.

The groom was in the kitchen,
Explaining to’ the bride;

The penis, not the scrotum,

Is the part that goes inside.

The village smithy he was there,
Sitting by the fire.

Doing abortions by the scores
With a red-hot piece of wire.

The smithy’s brother he was there,
A mighty man was he.

He lined the women against the wall,
And shagged ’em three by three.

D/FW H? Songbook -- May, 1992

Mrs. O’Malley she was there,
She had the crowd in fits.
Jumping off the mantelpiece,
And landing on her tits.

The village vicar he was there,
Dressed in his long black shroud.
Swinging on the chandelier,

And pissing on the crowd.

The parson’s daughter she was there,
The cunning little runt.

With poison ivy on her tits,

And thistles up her cunt.

Little Tommy he was there,
He was only eight.

Too young to fuck the ladies,
So he had to masturbate.

Little Jimmy he was there,
The leader of the choir,

He hit the balls of all the boys
To make their voices higher.

The tax collector he was there,
Collecting all his tax.

The women who couldn’t pay
Were paying on their backs.

The village lawyer he was there,
Collecting all his fees.

The men who couldn’t pay
Were paying on their knees.

The village baker she was there,

All covered up in dough.

Men were kneading her up and down,
And slippin’ it in her ho’

"| = MAYOR BAYSWATER’S DAUGHTER (AND THE HAIRS
DI-DOO
The mayor of Bayswater, he had a pretty daughter,

And the hairs on her dicky-di-doo hung down to her knees.

AIRS ON HER DICKY-

Our best Harriet Elizabeth Has gonorrhea and syphilis,
And the hairs on her dicky-di-doo hung down to her knees.

CHORUS And the hairs, and the hairs,
and the hairs on her dicky-di-doo hung down to her knees.
One black one, one white one, and one with a bit of shite on,
And the hairs of her dicky-di-doo hung down to her knees.
(And one with a fairy light on to show us the way.)
I’ve licked it, I’ve kissed it, It tastes like a chocolate biscuit, and the hairs...
I’ve stroked it, I’ve poked it, I’ve rolled it up and smoked it, and the hairs...
I’ve smelt it, I’ve felt it, It’s just like a bit of velvet, and the hairs...
I’ve seen it, I’ve seen it, I’ve laid right in between it, and the hairs...
auld not believe my eyes, When I peered between her thighs, and the hairs...
She came from Glamorgan, With a.cunt like a barrel organ, and the hairs...
Her hairs are so tangled, Her first-born was strangled, and the hairs...
If she were my daughter, I’d have them cut shorter, and the hairs...
If she were my sister, I’d never ever kiss her, and the hairs...
She slept with a demon, Who washed her with semen, and the hairs...
She-married an Italian, With balls like a fucking stallion, and the hairs...
She sat on the waterfront, With the waves lapping up and down her cunt, and the hairs...
She married a Spaniard, With a prick like a bloody lanyard, and the hairs...
You'd need a coal minor To find her vagina, and the hairs...

She married a Fiji, With lips like a fuckin’ squeegee, and the hairs...

was always just hit-or-miss, Whether I could find her clitoris, ‘cuz the hairs...

. JRTH ATLANTIC SQUADRON (THE GOOD SHIP VENUS)
Twas on the good ship Venus, by Christ you should have seen us,
The figurehead was a whore in a bed, and the mast was the Captain’s penis.

CHORUS Away, away, away we go with a fife and drum,
Here we cum, full of rum,
Looking for women who peddle their bums,
In the North Atlantic Squadron.

ALTERN:  Frigging on the rigging, (Tossing on the crossing),
Wanking on the planking, (Masturbating on the grating),
There’s fuck all else to do.

The ship’s dogs name was Rover, the whole crew did him over,
We ground and ground that faithful hound, From Singapore to Dover.

The Captain’s wife was Mabel, whenever she was able,
She gave the crew their daily screw, upon the galley table.

His wife was baptized Charlotte, who was born and bred a harlot,
Her legs at night were lily-white, but in the morning they were scarlet

ae cabin boy’s name was Kipper, a cunning little nipper.
He lined his ass with broken glass, and circumcised the skipper.

And the ladies of the nation arose in indignation,
They stuffed his bum with chewing gum, a smart retaliation.

The First Mate’s name was Hopper, by Christ he had a whopper.
Twice round his neck, once round the deck, and up his ass for a stopper.

The Second Mate’s name was Carter, by God he was a farter.
When the wind wouldn’t blow, and the ship wouldn’t go, Carter, the farter, would start her.

The Third Mate’s name was Wiggun, by God he had a big ’un.
We bashed that cock, with a bloody rock, for cumming in the riggin’.

The Fourth Mate’s name was Morgan, a homosexual Gorgon.
A dozen crows, in a row, could pose upon his organ.

The Fifth Mate’s name was Slater, he was a masturbator.
He’d pump and pump his massive stump, and clean the mess up later.

_ “he Sixth mate’s name was Andy, by God that man was randy.
we boiled’his bum in red-hot rum for cumming in the brandy.

{ ‘E WILD WEST SHOW

‘CcORUS We're off to see the Wild West Show, The elephant and the kangaroo-o-o
Never mind the weather, as long as we’re together,
We're off to see the Wild West Show.

[Now here in this corner, ladies and gentleman we have the (tattooed lady)]
[The (tattooed lady) Fantastic! incredible! Holy Hell, fire shit, tell us about it. (Mother Fucker)]

THE TATTOOED LADY: Well the tattooed lady has a "W’ on her left cheek, and another "W’ on
her right cheek, so when she does cartwheels, she spells, °WOW MOM WOW MOM wow...’

ANOTHER TATTOOED LADY: Well this tattooed lady has "MERRY CHRISTMAS’ tattooed on
her left thigh, and "HAPPY NEW YEAR’ tattooed on her right thigh. She’s always telling the men
to cum up and see her between the holidays.

ONE MORE TATTOOED LADY: This country-western gal has a tattoo of Roy Clark on her left
thigh, and a tattoo of George Strait on her right thigh ... and it looks like she’s got a new one of
Willie Nelson in the middle. :

STILL ANOTHER DAMN TATTOOED LADY: On one leg she has tattooed ’FIRE’, on the other
leg she has tattooed BRIMSTONE’ ... and in between it looks like hell.

"MALE MATHEMATICIAN: This lovely lady believes this (fingers 3 inches apart) is 12 inches.
MATHEMATICAL IMPOSSIBILITY: Here we have a young lady who was ate before she was 7.

ANTIQUE SALES LADY: The antique sales lady only sells period furniture ... everything has
stains on it.

THE FUKOWI TRIBE: This tribe, lives in the Grassland of Africa, where the grass grows to be
five feet high. Unfortunately, the Fukowi only grow to be four feet tall. All day long the members
of this tribe go through the land shouting, "We're the Fukowi, Where the fuck are we."

THE LAUGHING HYENA: This animal lives up in the mountains, and once every year he cums
down to eat. Once every two years he cums down to drink. And once every three years he cums
down for sexual intercourse. What the hell he has to fucking laugh about, I don’t know.

THE GIRAFFE: The giraffe is one of the most popular animals in the animal kingdom. [Why?]
Well, every time he goes into a bar he says, "The high balls are on me."

THE LEO-PARD: The leopard is the only living calendar -- it has one spot on its coat for every day
of the year. [What about leap year?] Why, just lift up his tail.

THE SABER-TOOTHED TIGER: The Sabertooth Tiger is the only 200 pound pussy that eats you.

*E_ DOGGIES’ MEETING
‘une doggies held a meeting, They came from near and far,
Some came by motorcycle, and some by motorcar.
Each doggie passed the entrance, Each doggie signed the book,
Each doggie hung his asshole, Upon his very own hook
One dog was not invited, Imagine his great ire,
He ran into the meeting room, and promptly shouted, ’FIRE!’

It threw them in a confusion, Without a second look, |
Each doggie grabbed an asshole, From off another’s hook.
A dog is often listless, for he is very sore.

To wear another asshole he’s never worn before.

And that’s the reason why sir, On land or sea or foam,

And that’s the reason why sir, Wherever doggies roam.

And that’s the reason why sir, when walking in the street.
And that’s the reason why sir, when doggies chance to meet.
And that’s the reason why sir, A dog will leave his bone,
To sniff another’s asshole, To see if it’s his own.

DEAD DOG ROVER
I’m looking over my dead dog Rover, that I over ran with the mower.

.e leg is missing, another is gone. The third leg is shredded all over the lawn.
‘Yhere’s no need explaining the one leg remaining, it’s spinning off the carport floor.
Oh I’m looking over my dead dog Rover that I over ran with the mower.

His hind leg is missing, so he won’t be pissing all over the lawn.

I’m looking over my dead dog Rover, that I hit with the power mower.

My dog’s not eating, he no longer barks. He hit the propeller and tumed into sparks.
There’s no need explaining there’s no dog remaining, he’s part of the grass tube feed.
Oh I’m looking over my dead dog Rover that I sent to eternity.

DEAD PUPPIES

Dead puppies, dead puppies, dead puppies aren’t much fun.
They don’t come when you call, they don’t chase squirrels at all.
Dead puppies aren’t much fun.

My dead puppy died last fall, he’s still rotting in the hall.
Dead puppies aren’t much fun. No No No

Mom says puppy’s days are through, she’s going to throw him in the stew.

Dead puppies aren’t much fun.
Dead puppies (dead dead dead) dead puppies, dead puppies aren’t much fun.

XE SEXUAL LIFE OF A CAMEL
when Lilly went down to pass water, she passed 2 magnificent stream.
She peed for an hour and a quarter, and you couldn’t see Lilly for steam.

CHORUS Singing, bum-titty-titty, bum-titty-titty-titty-bum
Singing, bum-titty-titty, bum-titty-titty-ay
Singing, bum-titty-titty, bum-titty-titty-titty-bum
Oh, the assholes are here to stay.

The sexual life of the camel, is stranger than anyone thinks.

In the height of the mating season, he tries to bugger the Sphinx.

(But) The Sphinx’s posterior orifice, is. blocked by the sands of the Nile.
Which accounts for the hump on the camel, and the Sphinx’s inscrutable smile.

The sexual life of the ostrich, is hard to understand.

At the height of the mating season, she buries her head in the sand.
(When) Along cums a male ostrich, with his prick riding high in the air.
Why doesn’t he up her and stuff her? He just doesn’t bloody well care.

The sexual life of a hasher paints a better picture than you can draw.
At the height of the mating season, we head off to Mardi Gras.
(Where) All the women hashers say that they don’t give a shit,

1 we say is, "Shut up, and show us your fucking tits.”

In the process of civilization, from anthropoid ape down to man,

It is generally held that the Navy, has buggered whatever it can.

(Yet) Recent extensive researches, by Darwin and Huxley, and Hall,

Have conclusively proved that the hedgehog, has never been buggered at all.

So cum all you hashers, and to the occasion crise.

Grab yourself a hedgehog, and give it a real surprise.

(The) Following simple instructions will ensure that you will not fail,
Simply ream out its ass with a hose pipe, and shave all the spines off his tail.

[ Note: Some hashers like to insert All Queers Together’ (the next song in this book) at this point -
although that’s not the point I’d like to insert at this time. B.G. ]

°Twas Christmas Eve in the harem, the eunuchs all standing there,
Watching the vestal virgins combing their pubic hair.

(When) Along came Father Christmas, his voice echoing down the halls,
"What would you like for Christmas?", the eunuchs all answered "Balls!"

™"tE_ LOBSTER SONG
.. Mister Fisherman, home from the sea,
Have you got a lobster you will sell to me?

CHORUS Singing aiy-tiddly-aiy, shit or bust.
Never let your bullocks dangle in the dust.

Yes sir, yes sir, I have three.
And the biggest of the bastards I will sell to thee.

So I took the lobster home, but I couldn’t find a dish (pot),
So I put the fucking lobster where the missus takes a piss (squat).

In the middle of the night, as you will know,
The missus got up to have a heave-ho.

Well first there came a groan, and then there came a grunt,
And the bloody lobster grabbed her by the cunt.

The missus grabbed the brush, and I grabbed the broom,
And we chased the fucking lobster round and round the room.

+ hit it on the head, and we hit it on the side,
.¢ hit that fucking lobster ’til the bastard died.

Oh, the story has a moral, and this-is it.
Always have a look before you take a shit.

Down in Nagasaki the monkey fucked the cat,
And all the cat could do was fuck the monkey back.

That’s the end of my story, there is no more,
There’s an apple up my ass, and you can have the core.

HOG CALLING TIME
When it’s hog calling time in Nebraska, When it’s hog calling time in Nebraska,
When it’s hog calling time in Nebraska, Then it’s hog calling time in Nebraska.

When it’s hog calling time in Arkansas, When it’s hog calling time in Arkansas,
When it’s hog calling time in Arkansas, Then it’s hog calling time in Arkansas.

(Editor’s Note: Feel free to make up some verses of your own!)

; XS ON THE ROOFTOPS

When you wake up in the moming with quite a stand,

From pressure of liquid in your semenary gland,

If you haven’t got a woman, use your bloody hand, As you revel in the joys of fornication.

CHORUS Cats on the roof tops, cats on the tiles, Cats with syphilis, cats with piles.
Cats with their assholes wreathed in smiles, as they revel in the joys of fornication.

The donkey is a lonely bloke, It’s very rare that he gets a poke,
But when he does, he lets it soak, As he revels in the joys of fomication.

The poor domestic doggie, on a chain all day, Never gets a chance to go and play,
So he licks at his dick in a frantic way, As he revels in the joys of fornication.

The hippopotamus, so it seems, Very rarely has wet dreams,
But when he does it cums in streams, As he revels in the joys of fornication.

The lady on the seaside was feeling blue, She saw children at it, and wanted it too,
So she bought three bananas, and ate the other two, As she revels in the joys of fornication.

The poor old rhino, so it appears, never gets to grind in a thousand years,
But when he does, he makes up for arrears, as he revels in the joys of fornication.

The poor ol’ desert camel has no water for a week, since he doesn’t drink, he can’t take a leak,
So he has to hold his water, so to speak, as he revels in the joys of fornication.

The camel like to have his fun, his night is made when he is done,
He always gets two humps for his one, as he revels in the joys of fornication.

Little Mary Johnson will be seven next July, she’d never been naughty, decided to give it a try,
She took her daddy’s walking stick and did it on the sly, as she revels in the joy of fornication.

Long-legged curates grind like goats, Pale-faced spinsters shag like shoats,
And the whole damn world stands by and gloats, As they revel in the joys of fornication.

The ostrich in the desert is a solitary chick, Without the opportunity to dip its wick,
But when he does -- it slips in thick, As he revels in the joys of fornication.

The ape is small’ and rather slow, Erect he stands a foot or so,
But when he cums -- it’s time to go, As he revels in the joys of fornication.

The flea disports among the trees, And there consorts with whom he please,
To fill the land with bastard fleas, As he revels in the joys of fornication.

ie elephant’s prick is big and round, A small one scales a thousand pounds,
Two together rock the ground, As they revel in the joys of fornication.

~ *REE VISITING HASHERS (THREE GERMAN OFFICERS)
(erith credit to (K)not (Whole, and apologies to Hans, Otto, and Fritz)

Three visiting hashers came over here, Parlez vous?

Three visiting hashers came over here, Parlez vous?

Three visiting hashers came over here,

To fuck our women and drink our beer,

Inky pinky parlez vous, oh blimy ...

They came upon a circle up. They pissed all around and drank right up.

Oh Grand Master have you a maiden fair? ‘With lily-white tits, and golden hair? / With blow job
lips and stringy hair?

Oh yes I have but she’s too new, To sleep with stinking hashers like you.
Oh Grandmaster I’m not too new, After all, I’ve already slept with you.
Yes, that’s true, but your so sweet, Perhaps you could just suck their feet.
Feet are fine but I prefer, They ride upon my mound of fur.

\ the old stairs she was led, They threw her down upon the bed.
They tied her to the leg of the bed, And fucked her ’til her cheeks were red.
Then they took her to the shed, and fucked her "til she was nearly dead.
They took her down a shady lane, And fucked her back to life again.
They fucked her up, they fucked her down, They fucked her right around the town.
They fucked her in, they fucked her out, They fucked her up the water spout.
Three months went by and all was well, Six months went by and she started to swell.
Nine months later she gave a grunt, And a little hasher popped out of her cunt.
The little hasher he grew and grew, He fucked his mother and his sister too.

The little hasher he went to hell, And there he started a hash as well.

1 XOPY (LUPE)

was down in Cunt Valley where the Red River flows.
Where cocksuckers flourish and maidenheads grow.
Twas there I met Loopy, the girl I adore.
She’s a hot-fucking, cocksucking, Mexican whore.

CHORUS She’ll fuck you, shell suck you, she’ll tickle your nuts,
And if you’re not happy she’ll suck out your guts.
She’ll wrap her legs ‘round you ’til you want to die;
But I’d rather eat Loopy than sweet cherry pie.

When Loopy was a young gitl, of just about eight;
She’d swing to and fro’ on the back garden gate.
The crossmember parted, the upright went in,

And since then she’s lived in a welter of sin.

Now Loopy is dead, and she lays in her tomb;

The worms crawl around in her decomposed womb.
The smile on her face, seems to say, "Give me more,
I’m a hot fucking, cocksucking, Mexican whore."

MAGGIE MAGGIE MAY

“TORUS Oh Maggie, Maggie May, they have taken her away,
She’ll never walk down life’s street anymore.
You dirty rotten scoundrel, you no good homeward bounder,
You dirty rotten bastard Maggie May.

On the night that Maggie died she called me to her side,

And left me with a pair of flannel drawers

They were tattered, they were torn, around the asshole they were worn,
Those old grey flannel drawers that Maggie wore.

They were buttoned, they were tucked in, they were ones that she had fucked in,
Those old grey flannel drawers that Maggie wore.

They were stained for many years, and had been entered through the rear,
Those old grey flannel drawers that Maggie wore.

When she hung them on the line, the sun refused to shine,

Those old grey flannel drawers that Maggie wore.

When she laid them on the ground, you could smell them miles around,
Those old grey flannel drawers that Maggie wore.

ELAINE SCHMIDT.
‘There once was a maiden named Adelaine Schmidt,
Who went to the doctor, ’cause she couldn’t shit.
He gave her some medicine all wrapped up in glass,
And up went the window, and out shot her ass.

CHORUS It was brown, brown, shit all around;
It was brown, brown, shit on the ground;
It was brown, brown, shit all around .
The whole world was covered with shit-shit-shit-shit!

A handsome young copper was walking his beat,
He happened to be on that side of the street.

He looked up so handsome, he looked up so spry,
And a big piece of shit hit him right in the eye.

He travelled to the east and he travelled to the west,
Then a bloody great turd hit him right in the chest.
He walked to the north, and he looked to the south,
Then another great turd hit him right in the mouth.

That handsome young copper, he cursed and he swore.
; called that young maiden a dirty old whore.

Now ’neath London bridge that copper does sit,

With a sign "round his neck saying, “Blinded by shit."

Two fast moving hashers came running along,
Throwing flour and paper and singing their song,
Singing, "Hi-Diddle-Diddle!" and flogging their dong.
The hares were trail setting; the pack won’t be long.

The hares found the copper alone by the pit;

Threw flour in the holes where his eyes used to fit.

The hares led the pack by a block and a bit,

Said, "We’ll lead those damn hounds thru these puddles of shit.

The hares Ied the pack to the edge of the pit,

They slipped and they slid in the puddles of shit.

The fell in the shiggy, right up to their tail,

‘Ere they sank out of sight, they had marked it True Trail!

The pack followed bravely, the pack followed true. They followed the hares into that vile brew.
They foliowed the true trail right into the pit. Soon the whole pack of hashers was drowning in shit.

his tale has a lesson if you think a bit. Don’t follow the true trail right into the pit.
Remember that hares can be dumb bloody fools, and in hashing, like loving, there’s no fucking rules.

Oh the eagles they fly high, and they shit right in your eye, Thank the lord cows don’t fly in Mobile.

There’s a girl by the name of Dinah in Mobile.
Who thinks there’s nothing finer than a prick up her vagina in Mobile.

Oh the vicar is a bugger in Mobile.
And the curate is another, and they bugger one another in Mobile.

There’s a shortage of bog paper in Mobile.
So they wait until it vapors and they light it with a taper in Mobile.

Oh the hashers get no tail in Mobile.
So for want of recreation, they indulge in masturbation, It’s a hell of a situation in Mobile.

There’s a girl with no ambition in Mobile.
id when she isn’t wishin’, she gets it in the kitchen from the local obstetrician in Mobile.

There’s a shortage of beer glasses in Mobile.
>Cuz the working classes steal them in masses and shove them up their asses.

If you’re ever thrown in jail in Mobile.
Well there’s no need for bail, ’cause the sheriff’s wife for sale in Mobile.

Oh the girls they wear tin undies in Mobile.
And they take them off on Sundays, you should see the boys on Mondays in Mobile.

The virgins they are rare in Mobile.
When they get their pubic hair, they're deflowered by the Mayor in Mobile.

Oh I chased the Colonel’s daughter in Mobile.
And I shagged her when I caught her, now the daughter’s got a daughter,
I guess I shouldn’t have caught her in Mobile.

There’s a lad named dirty Danny in Mobile.
And he likes a bit of fanny, so he gets it off his granny in Mobile.

There’s a shortage of whores in Mobile.

On, she went to the well to make a wish,
But the skunk from her cunt killed off all the fish.

CHORUS She’s a dirty mother fucker, she’s a lousy whore,
She’s a girl from Singapore
What did the drunk say?;
Bum titty bum titty, bum titty bum titty bum titty bum titty, bum titty bum.

She went to the church to pray for the people,
But the skunk from her cunt knocked the cross off the steeple.

Oh, she went to the alley to try and shag,
But the skunk from her cunt made the maggots all gag.

She went to Baylor on a medical trip,
But the skunk from her cunt just continued to drip.

Oh, she went to the seashore just to lie on the beach,
But the skunk from her cunt made the locals all reach.
Oh, she went to the seashore just to get some sun,

t the skunk from her cunt made the locals all run.

Well, she laid a hash which would run an hour,
Using the skunk from her cunt instead of flour.

They made her sing a song at the end of the day,
But the skunk from her cunt made the circle go away.

WALKING DOWN CANAL STREET

Walking down Canal Street, knocking on every door --
God Damn Son-of-a-bitch, couldn’t find a whore.

When.I finally found a whore, she was tall and thin --
God Damn Son-of-a-bitch, couldn’t get it in.

When I finally got it in, I turned it all about --

God Damn Son-of-a-bitch, couldn’t get it out.

When I finally got it out it was red and sore —

God Damn Son-of-a-bitch, you should never fuck a whore.

YOUR LITTLE BABY BROTHER’S GOT A BIGGER DICK THAN YOU
Well, you heard about sex, and wanted to indulge,
But the women all laughed at the size of your bulge.

CHORUS I used to think it funny, but now I’m blue,
*Cuz your little baby brother’s got a bigger dick than you.
As the girls say, ’Dick, teeny dick, teeny, dick teeny dick.’
I used to think it funny, but now I’m blue,
*Cuz your little baby brother’s got a bigger dick than you.

Well you thought it’d be nice to give sex a whirl,
But the women all thought that you -was a girl.

Well you flashed the girls you were trying to impress,
But the women all thought you should be wearing a dress.

Well you went to the bar to pick up a chick,
But the women all laughed seeing you have no dick.

Well the women all heard you talking about your nine-inch tool,
But the lump of your stump shows you be a lying fool.

Well you finally met a women who would let you in,
Saying the lump of your stump barely made it a sin.

Well you were having sex, trying to make the hard-on linger,
She said, ’instead of the lump of your stump, please use your finger.’

You saw some girls and pulled out your staff,
But the lump of your stump made the women all laugh.

BY THE LIGHT (FLICKERING MATCH)

By the light (tsh-tsh-tsh tsh-tsh-tsh) Of the flickering match (tsh-tsh-tsh tsh-tsh-tsh)

I saw her snatch (tsh-tsh-tsh tsh-tsh-tsh) In the watermelon patch (tsh-tsh-tsh tsh-tsh-tsh)
By the light (tsh-tsh-tsh tsh-tsh-tsh) Of the flickering match (tsh-tsh-tsh tsh-tsh-tsh)

I saw her gleam, I heard her scream,

You are burning my snatch (tsh-tsh-tsh tsh-tsh-tsh) with your gad damn match.

My flickering match, and there was Grandma swinging on the outhouse door, without her nighty,
And there was Grandpa, swinging on the other side -- there was a (K)not (W)hole.

By the light of a flickering match, I saw her snatch, by the light of a flickering match.

By the light of a flickering match, I saw the steam, I heard her scream.
I was burning her snatch, with my flickering match.

{ TRAVELLER

‘Nvame home on Saturday night, as drunk as I could be,

And there was a hat upon the rack, where my hat ought to be.

So I said to my wife, the curse of my life, "Explain this thing to me,
Whose is the hat upon the rack, where my hat ought to be?"

"Oh, you’re drunk, you’re drunk, you silly old fool, you’re drunk as a fool can be,
That’s not a hat upon the rack, but a chamber pot you see.”

Well, I’ve travelled this wide world over, ten thousand miles or more,

But a jerry with a hatband on, I never saw before.

I came home on Saturday night, as drunk as I could be,

And there was a horse in the stable, where my horse ought to be.
So I said to my wife, the curse of my life, "Explain this thing to me,
Whose is the horse in the stable, where my horse ought to be?"

"Oh, you’re drunk, you’re drunk, you silly old fool, you’re drunk as a fool can be,
That’s not a horse in the stable, but a milk cow you can see."

Well, I’ve travelled this wide world over, ten thousand miles or more,

But a milk cow with a saddle on, I never saw before.

I came home on Saturday night, as drunk as I could be,

d there were some boots beside the bed, where my boots ought to be.
ov I said to my wife, the curse of my life, "Explain this thing to me,
Whose are these boots beside the bed, where my boots ought to be?"

"Oh, you’re drunk, you’re drunk, you silly old fool, you’re drunk as a fool can be,
Those aren’t boots beside the bed, but some slippers you can see."

Well, I’ve travelled this wide world over, ten thousand miles or more,

But a pair of slippers with black feet, I never saw before.

I came home on Saturday night, as drunk as I could be,

And there were some breeches beside the bed, where my breeches ought to be.
So I said to my wife, the curse of my life, "Explain this thing to me,

Whose are the breeches a lying there, where my breeches ought to be?"

"Oh, you’re drunk, you’re drunk, you silly old fool, you’re drunk as a fool can be,
Those aren’t a pair of breeches, but a polishing cloth you see."

Well, I’ve travelled this wide world over, ten thousand miles or more,

But a polishing cloth with buttons on, I never saw before.

I came home on Saturday night, as drunk as I could be,

And there was a head on the pillow, where my head ought to be.

So I said to my wife, the curse of my life, "Explain this thing to me,
hose is the head a lying there, where my head ought to be?”

* VAD HER UP AND BANG AWAY
yell, up she came, and down she got, then she showed me her you-know-what,
Asked me if I’d like a shot - with my eighteen pounder.

CHORUS Load her up, and bang away, load her up, and bang away,
Load her up, and bang away, with my eighteen pounder.

I tried her box, and found it locked, so I tried her back door and found it blocked,
I just went off half-cocked - with my eighteen pounder.

Then I took her to a shady del, I released my safety and banged like hell,
I missed the bulls-eyes, but I drilled a well - with my eighteen pounder.

So I took her down beside the docks, I sighted at her pretty box,
I missed her box, but crushed the rocks - with my eighteen pounder.

Took my chances in the bed, I missed her snatch and hit her head,
Ricocheted and killed her dead - with my eighteen pounder.

Then I took her to the burial ground, I dug a hole and laid her down,
Just for practice, one more round - with my eighteen pounder.

\-RA-RA-BOOM-DE-AY
1 got a gal named Sassafras, she’s got pimples on her ass.
Some is big, and some is small, some you can hardly see at all.

CHORUS Ta-ra-ra Boom-de-ay, Ta-ra-ra Boom-de-ay,
Ta-ra-ra Boom-de-ay, Ta-ra-ta Boom-de-ay.

As a Freshman she was pure, ’til the Dean came by on tour.
He was such a lousy lover, that he made a mother of her.

As a Sophomore she would shrink, ’til one day she learned to drink.
Now they fill her up with gin, and anyone can put it in.

As a Junior she was told, she could sell the stuff for gold,
She got the proxy to endorse, her majoring in the intercourse.

As a Senior after class, she was selling instant ass,
Then they kicked her out of school, for cumming in the swimming pool.

Now she hangs around the gates, special commutation rates,
Twenty bucks for twenty boffs, only half the price for profs.

GRANDPA

ay, many years ago, when I was twenty three,

I was.married to a widow, who was as pretty as can be.
The widow had a grown-up daughter, who had hair of red,
My father fell in love with her, and soon the two were wed.

This made my Dad my son-in-law, which changed my very life,
My daughter was my mother, for she was my father’s wife.

To complicate the matter, even though it brought me joy,

I soon became the father of a bouncing baby boy.

This baby then became the brother of my Dad,

And so became my uncle, though it made me very sad,

For if he was my uncle, then he also was the brother

Of the red-haired grown-up daughter, who, of course, is my step mother.

And I’m my own Grandpa, I’m my own Grandpa.
Sounds funny I know, but really it’s so -- I am my own Grandpa.

My Father’s wife then had a son, who kept them on the run,
This child became my Grandson, for he was my daughter’s son.
My wife is now my father’s mother, and it makes me blue.
Although she is my wife, she is my Grandmother too.

Now if she is my Grandmother, then I am her Grandchild.
Every time I think of it, it really drives me wild.

Now I have become the strangest case you ever saw,

As husband of my Grandmother, I am my own Grandpa.

And I’m my own Grandpa, I’m my own Grandpa.
Sounds funny I know, but really it’s so -- I am my own Grandpa.

My Uncle’s Mom is therefore, married to my Pa,

His sister is my wife, thereby being my brother-in-law.

If he grows up and has a girl, as he really ought ta,

She’ll be his half sister, and my niece, cousin, and daughter.

And I’m my own Grandpa, I’m my own Grandpa.
Sounds funny I know, but really it’s so -- I am my own Grandpa.

” “EDEAN SCHOOL
ye are from Roedean, good girls are we, we take great pride in our virginity,
We take precautions to avoid all abortions, for we are from Roedean School.

CHORUS Up school, up school, up school, right up school!
Laah-lah, laah-lah, lah, lah, lah, lah, lah. Laah-lah, laah-lah, lah, Jah, lah, lah, lah!

Our school porter, he is a fool, he’s only got a teeny weeny tool,
All right for keyholes and little girls’ pee-holes, but not for the girls at Roedean School.

When we go out to the Vicar’s for tea, he like to bounce us up and down on his knee,
We feed him brandy, which makes him feel randy, for we are from Roedean School. -

When we go down to the beach for a swim, the people remark on the size of our quim,
You can bet your bottom dollar, it’s as big as a horse’s collar, for we are from Roedean School.

Our house mistress, she can’t be beat, she let’s us go walking in the street,
We sell our titties for three penny bitties, right outside of Roedean School.

Each week at Roedean we have a dance, we don’t wear bras, and we don’t wear pants,
We like to give all the fellows a chance, for we are from Roedean School.

+ are from Roedean, lesbos are we, caused by living in an all-girl dormit’ry,
at § lights out at seven, candles out at eleven, for we are from Roedean School.

Our school doctor, she is a beaut, teaches us to swerve when our boyfriend’s shoot,
It saves many marriages, and forces miscarriages, for we are from Roedean School.

We go to Roedean, don’t we have pluck, we go to bed without asking for a buck,
So cum on over boys, and you may be in luck, for we are from Roedean School.

We go to Roedean, don’t we have fun, we know exactly how it is to be done,
When we lie down, we hole it in one, for we are from Roedean School.

We have a new girl, her name is Flo, nobody thought that she would have a go,
But she surprised the Vicar, by raising him quicker, than any other girl at Roedean School.

In winter we wear our J.D.s, long combinations well below our knees,
It’s all right for dragging, but no good for shagging, for we are from Roedean School.

We have a new girl, her name is Jane, she only likes it now and again.
And again and again and again and again, for we are from Roedean School.

Those girls from Cheltenham, they are just sissies, they get worked up over one or two kissies,
takes wax candles and long broom handles, to rouse the girls at Roedean School.

’ GOD HOW THE MONEY ROLLS IN (HOW THE MONEY ROLLS IN)
‘:une: My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean.

My father makes counterfeit money, my mother makes synthetic gin,
My sister sells kisses to sailors, my God how the money rolls in.

CHORUS Rolls in, rolls in, my God how the money rolls in, rolls in.
Rolls in, rolls in, my God how the money rolls in.

My mother’s a boarding housekeeper, each night when the evening grows dim,
She hangs out a little red lantem, my God how the money rolls in.

My cousin’s a Harley Street surgeon, with instruments long, sharp and thin,
He only does one operation, my God how the money rolls in.

Uncle Joe is a registered plumber, his business is in holes and in tin,
He’ll plug your hole for a tenner, my God how the money rolls in.

My brother’s a slum missionary, he saves fallen women from sin,
He’ll save you a blonde for a dollar, my God how the money tolls in.

My Granddad sells cheap prophylactics, he punctures the tip with a pin,
t Grandma gets rich from abortions, my God how the money rolls in.

My sister’s a barmaid in Sydney, for a shilling she’ll strip to the skin,
She’s stripping from morning to midnight, my God how the money rolls in.

My aunt keeps a girl seminary, teaching young girls to begin,
She doesn’t say where they finish, my God how the money rolls in.

I’ve shares in the very best companies, in tramways, tobacco, and tin,
In brothels in Rio de Janeiro, my God how the money rolls in.

We've started an old fashioned gin shop, a regular palace of sin,
The principal girl is my Grandma, my God how the money rolls in.

My brother, he whittles out candles, from wax that is exceptionally soft,
He says it will cum in real handy, if ever his business falls off.

AE SCOTSMAN’S KILT

.. ell, a Scotsman clad in kilt left the bar one evening fair,

One could tell by the way he walked that he’d drunk more than his share.
He staggered ’round until he could no longer keep his feet.

And he stumbled off into the grass to sleep beside the street.

CHORUS Ring-ding-diddle-liddle-i-de-o, Ring di diddle-i-o.
[Last Line] (And he stumbled off into the grass to sleep beside the street.)

About that time two young and lovely girls just happened by.
One said to the other with a twinkle in her eye.

"See that sleeping Scotsman so strong and handsome built.

I wonder if it’s true what they don’t wear beneath the kilt."

They crept up on the sleeping Scotsman quiet as can be.

Lifted up his kilt about an inch so they could see.

And there behold for them to view beneath his Scottish skirt.
Was nothing more than God had graced him with upon his birth.

They marvelled for a moment then one said, "We must be gone.
Let’s leave a present for our friend before we move along."
As a gift they left a blue silk ribbon tied into a bow.

-ound his bonnie staff, where the kilt will lift and show.

Now the Scotsman woke to nature’s call and stumbled toward the trees.
Behind the bush he lifts his kilt and gawks at what he sees.

And in his startled voice he said to what before his eyes.

"Oh lad I don’t know where you’ve been, but I see you’ve won first prize.

Our Scottish friend still dressed in kilt continued down the street.
He hadn’t gone ten yards or more when a girl he chanced to meet.
She said, "I’ve heard what’s neath that kilt, tell me is it so?"

He said, "Just put your hand up, miss, if you’d really like to know."

She put her hand right up his kilt, and much to her surprise,

The Scotsman smiled and a very strange look came into his eyes.

She cried, "Why sir that’s gruesome." And then she heard him roar,
"If you put your hand up once again you'll find it grew some’ more."
